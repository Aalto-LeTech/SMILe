# Scala Media Interactive Learning (SMILe)

This project is targeted mainly for instructors and students of introductory programming courses. From instructors'
viewpoint, its goal is to provide means to motivate students via contextualized teaching. There are many ways to provice
context, and the approach choosen here is the one of multimedia computation, that is, programmatically creating and
processing multimedia content in a creative way. To provide the necessary scaffolding for novice students already
challenged to learn for example logical and algorithmic thinking, programming concepts and paradigms, a new programming
language (in this case, [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/)), and the related development tools, this library offers
ways to concentrate only in the topics to be practiced while still producing hopefully interesting and attractive
results.

This project is the successor of [SMCL.](https://github.com/Aalto-LeTech/Scala-Media-Computation)

## Tools & Dependencies

This library uses [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) as its build tool.

## Repository Content and Project Structure

The project consists of two parts: SMCL Core and SMCL Bitmap Viewer. Both of these are to be cross-compiled for two
platforms: One consisting of the Java Virtual Machine and the Abstract Window Toolkit from Java's class library, while
the other one being JavaScript and HTML5 for browser-based usage. At the moment, the JS/HTML5 version has not been
developed, and the development efforts have been focused on the JVM/AWT version.

This repository contains only the platform-independent files needed to create a fresh development setup of the project:
source code and other resources as well as the some settings for IntelliJ IDEA. The essential structure of this
repository is given in the table below:

Build products---including the packaged Java archives (.jar files)---are located under the
generated `<project>/js/target` and `<project>/jvm/target` folders.

## Setting Up a Development Environment

### Installing Git

### Cloning This Repository onto a Local Mass Storage

One possibility to clone this repository onto your local mass storage is to use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) itself. From
command line this can be done like below:

```
git clone https://github.com/Aalto-LeTech/Scala-Media-Computation.git
```

This will create a `Scala-Media-Computation` folder into the folder in which it is executed. Other possibilities to
clone the repository include e.g. IDE plugins and other graphical user interfaces developed to make using of Git easier.

### Installing Java Development Kit

### Configuring Maven and Ivy

While Apache Maven is not needed to build this project, local artifact repositories for Maven and Ivy are needed when
publishing build products of this project. What's more, SBT uses Apache Ivy for all dependency management, which means
that a local Ivy-style artifact repository is definitely needed.
